## Discussion

On [Covid and masking at
school](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278385v1). See
[this
commentary](https://vinayprasadmdmph.substack.com/p/a-new-mask-study-is-poised-to-affect)
for discussion, and [the state policy on testing at the
time](https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/bitstream/handle/2452/856102/on1301933851.pdf)

> We estimate that lifting of school masking requirements was associated with
an additional 44.9 (95% CI: 32.6, 57.1) COVID-19 cases per 1,000 students and
staff over the 15 weeks since the lifting of the statewide school masking
requirement, representing nearly 30% of all cases observed in schools during
that time.

The favorite equation:

> estimate = estimand + bias + noise

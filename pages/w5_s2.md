## HRT

Now imagine yourself as a doctor in 1992. You are a careful reader of clinical
trials, and you have read the 1992 paper.

* How would you have responded to the paper?  To the authors â€” perhaps in
  a letter to the journal that published the review?  To your patients, asking
  about HRT?
* If you were on a committee thinking about recommendations for HRT, what would
  *your* recommendations have been?  And how would you have persuaded your
  colleagues of your recommendations?

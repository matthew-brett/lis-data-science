## On advice

Advice from the American Pediatric Association: [Hypoallergenic infant
formulas](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920165) (2000).

> Mothers should eliminate peanuts and tree-nuts (e.g. almonds, walnuts) and
consider eliminating eggs, cows-milk, fish and perhaps other foods from their
diets when nursing.

Side-note — it's very difficult to access the advice paper above.

The [UK recommended avoiding peanuts in 1998](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20120209132957/http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/cotpeanutall.pdf):

> Peanut allergy, unlike allergy to other food allergens such as cows’ milk
protein, rarely resolves with age. Although some individuals have mild allergic
reactions, severe reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis, are
possible. In view of this, a precautionary view was taken in formulating advice
on peanut consumption by pregnant and breast-feeding women, infants and young
children.

> (ii) during weaning, and until at least three years of age, the diets of
these children should not include peanuts and foods containing peanut
products as these may increase the risk of sensitisation and should be
avoided.

You can see the then-current state of the evidence in the UK report.

A 2015 [Randomized Trial of Peanut Consumption in Infants at Risk for Peanut
Allergy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850) notes that:

> The prevalence of peanut allergy among children in Western countries has
doubled in the past 10 years, and peanut allergy is becoming apparent in
Africa and Asia.

Design:

> We randomly assigned 640 infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both to
consume or avoid peanuts until 60 months of age.

Result:

> Among the 530 infants in the intention-to-treat population [...] the
prevalence of peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13.7% in the avoidance
group and 1.9% in the consumption group (P<0.001).

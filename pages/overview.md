## Description

This course continues your learning on coding for data analysis.

As you have already seen, coding a fundamental skill for modern research.
Becoming fluent in using code for data gives you enormous power and flexibility
for data analysis. It will also give you tools for deeper understanding of data
analysis and statistics.

## What we cover

This course goes beyond where you ended last year, in teaching the techniques
of data analysis through code.  We will use code to give deeper explanations of
how analysis techniques work, so you will have a better foundation for using
them, and extending them.

We will cover:

*   A revision and extension on loading, selecting and plotting data with
    Pandas data frames.
*   The principles of probability from simulation using random numbers from the
    computer.
*   Understanding distributions of data through resampling using the bootstrap technique.
*   Linear fitting and the true nature of correlation.
*   Using the computer to search for best solutions; *optimization* as
    a general way to do this.
*   Classifying data, and the basics of machine learning.
*   Searching for patterns in data with clustering.

## We've taught this before

You've chosen this course, so we're guessing that you feel at least reasonably
confident that you will able to learn the material.  In case you do still have
some doubts, this section is to reassure you.  The course we are teaching here,
we and others have taught before to other students, like you.  We base this
course on a very successful and widely-adopted [course for undergraduates in
all subjects in Berkeley](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8),
We have also taught this course to undergraduates in Birmingham. 

## Resources

We will be following the online class textbook at
<https://lisds.github.io/textbook>.

Please consider further background reading (see the background reading page).

## Tools

We will be using [Python and the Jupyter
Notebook](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/the_software.html). You do not
need to install anything on your computer; we have set up a system to run
Python / Jupyter in the cloud so you can do your work in the cloud, via a web
browser.  We do strongly suggest that you do install the same software on your
computer, and we'll support you in doing that.

## Policies

See the policies on working together.  Please make sure you read and understand
that page; it covers collaboration (very good!) and straight copying of work
(very bad!).

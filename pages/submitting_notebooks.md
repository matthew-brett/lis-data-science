You should do your exercises in the [Python / Jupyter cloud
system](https://ds.lis.2i2c.cloud)

Each exercise will have a link that will take you to the exercise on the cloud
system.

When you click on the exercise / homework link, the cloud system will fetch the
files you need, and it will open the notebook in your browser.

Now fill in the notebook, following the instructions in the notebook.

When you have finished, don't forget to save the notebook file:

[Notebook save]({{ link_base }}/images/jp_save_checkpoint.png)

Next, download the file to your laptop, with the "Download as ..." item on the
"File" menu.  Download the notebook as a "Notebook (.ipynb)" file:

![]({{ link_base }}/images/jp_download_as.png)

Finally, upload the `.ipynb` file from your laptop as the submission for the assignment.

Any problems, use the Course Noticeboard on Cortex, or email

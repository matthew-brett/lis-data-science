This is the first synchronous session.

We will start by discussing the first preparation exercise - the Gapminder
exercise on how to be wrong â€” see the content page for that exercise.

Then we will move on to an introduction to code and data, using the interactive
Jupyter notebook system.


We will cover the material in the following pages in the textbook:

* [Plotting the classics](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/Plotting_the_Classics.html)
* [Literary characters](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/Literary_Characters.html)
* [Another kind of character](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/Another_Kind_Of_Character.html)
* [Using Jupyter Notebooks](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/using_jupyter.html)
* [More on Jupyter Notebooks](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/more_on_jupyter.html)

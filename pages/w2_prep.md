The preparation for this week follows on the from preparation
from the previous two weeks.

For the first prep, you had some practice in being wrong — many
of the opinions we have inherited do not stand up to scrutiny
with data.

For the second prep, you were considering causation, and
experiments, by looking at John Snow and the cholera epidemic.
Through careful thought, and a natural experiment, John Snow
discovered that water was the main way that cholera spreads.

The preparation for this week goes a bit deeper into both these
issues.

## On being less wrong

— or perhaps on being less stupid.

Read this article by Jonathan Haidt: [Why the past 10 years of American
life have been uniquely
stupid](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/).
Read carefully, and to the end, for a description of the engine that makes
us less wrong, and diagnosis of the very modern diseases of that engine.
The article concentrates on the US (the country), but there is much that
applies to us (the pronoun) too.

As reflection for the class later, please do the following exercise:

### Being less wrong exercise

Select a belief that you hold strongly, but that you have not
discussed vigorously and at length with someone who disagrees
with that belief.  Your task is to sketch, in two paragraphs, the
best and most convincing argument against your belief *using
data*.  Be your own teacher.

We will discuss in class.

## More on causality

We will be using the book "Thinking clearly with data".   Find it
on Perlego.  There are three physical copies in the library.

Read the following chapters:

* Preface
* Chapter 3: Causation
* Chapter 9: Why correlation does not imply causation

Do exercises:

* 3.1
* 3.4
* 9.3
* 9.4

We will discuss these in class.

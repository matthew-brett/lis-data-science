This is the first synchronous session.

We will start by discussing the first preparation exercise - the Gapminder
exercise on how to be wrong â€” see the content page for that exercise.

Then we will move on to some revision on Python, the Jupyter, Pandas, and working with the cloud system we have set up for the School this year.

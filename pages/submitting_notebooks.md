You should do your exercises in the [Python / Jupyter cloud
system](https://ds.lis.2i2c.cloud)

Each exercise will have a link that will take you to the exercise on the cloud
system.

When you click on the exercise / homework link, the cloud system will fetch the
files you need, and it will open the notebook in your browser.

Now fill in the notebook, following the instructions in the notebook.

When you have finished, don't forget to save the notebook file:

![Notebook save]({{ link_base }}/images/jp_save_checkpoint.png)

After you have saved the notebook, make sure that all the tests in the notebook
run correctly, by selecting "Restart & Run All" from the "Kernel" menu.  This
will re-run the notebook from the top to the bottom, with a fresh kernel.

This is the same procedure we will use when marking your notebook.  Make sure
all the tests that passed before, are still passing.  If they are not, make
sure you haven't overwritten any of the variables that you used for the
original tests.   Keep saving and doing "Restart & Run All" until you are
satisfied.

Next, download the file to your laptop, with the "Download as ..." item on the
"File" menu.  Download the notebook as a "Notebook (.ipynb)" file:

![Download as]({{ link_base }}/images/jp_download_as.png)

Finally, upload the `.ipynb` file from your laptop as the submission for the assignment.

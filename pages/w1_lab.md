As in each week, we will finish with a lab session, were you can work at your
own speed on exercises for material during the week.

You can work in pairs for the labs, and in fact, we recommend that you do.
There is some evidence that working in pairs can improve learning for
programming.

We are in the process of setting up the system on which you can run these
exercises, and we will post live links when we can.  For my reference, the
exercises for the lab are:

* Reading Count Dracula
* Expressions

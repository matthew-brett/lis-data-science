# Background reading

## Python for scientific data analysis

For online material, the
[Berkeley course in data science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com) is
a very good introduction.  You'll see that we have used a lot of their material
for this course. The [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org)
organization has good online lessons that introduce various tools for using
code in science, including an [introduction to
Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation), although this
lesson goes at a much faster pace than our course. If you want a set of online
materials for using the scientific libraries, that does assume some background
in using Python, try the [Scipy Lectures](https://scipy-lectures.org).   If you
know Python reasonably well, and you need an introduction to data science for
Python, then [Jake VanderPlas'](http://vanderplas.com) [Python data science
handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook) is a good
resource.  It is very clear, well-written, and up to date, but it is designed for readers that know Python well.  If that is you, I highly recommend it.

The definitive book on the Pandas data library is [Python for data
analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book) by Wes McKinney.  It is well-written,
and a good reference.  Again, you'll get the most benefit from it as a reference, or if you already feel reasonably confident in using Python.

## Python programming in general

You will find many good free online resources for continuing your learning on
Python programming in general.

My current recommendation is a book and course by [Allen
Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp) that he first called "Think Like
a Computer Scientist" and later called "Think Python".  It is well-written, and
has gone through several versions, so the material is well tested.

The latest edition of "Think Python" is the second, and you can get it free as
a PDF, or order a print copy - see the [Think Python 2e web
page](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e).

There is an interactive edition based on the same original text at [Think Like
a Computer Scientist interactive
edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html).

## Principles of understanding data

For good discussion of many important topics in understanding data, we highly
recommend the book *Thinking Clearly with Data*, by Ethan Bueno de Mesquita and
Anthony Fowler (2021).  You can [find this on
Perlego](https://www.perlego.com/book/2646783/thinking-clearly-with-data-a-guide-to-quantitative-reasoning-and-analysis-pdf)
if you have access.

## Visualization

Please consider reading Edward Tufte's extraordinary book on *The Visual
Display of Quantitative Information*.  It is an extremely powerful, cogent and
beautiful exposition of using graphics and plots to convey information in data.

## On the project

See the project pages for more detail.

Example datasets I discussed in class:

* I gave the example of automated calculation of re-offending
  probability, that seems to over-predict re-offending in Black
  people — [Propublica sentencing
  article](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
  and [description of the
  analysis](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm).
* [Is Defunding the Police a “Luxury
  Belief”?](https://www.manhattan-institute.org/is-defunding-the-police-a-luxury-belief)
  — [associated data](https://osf.io/cq8rt).
* There is a lot of controversy about the extent to which US
  police are more violent to, or more likely to kill, Black
  people.  See [Reconciling Results on Racial Differences in
  Police Shootings](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26452738) for
  discussion, and [the matching data
  site](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/114428).

## Optimization and slopes

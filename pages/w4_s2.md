About a figure in the [2017 Climate Science Special
Report](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/)

> There have been marked changes in temperature extremes across the contiguous
United States. The number of high temperature records set in the past two
decades far exceeds the number of low temperature records. (Very high
confidence) (Ch. 6, Fig. ES.5)

See [Figure ES5](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/img/figure/es-5.png)

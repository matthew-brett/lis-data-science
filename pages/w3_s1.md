## On advice

Advice from the American Pediatric Association: [Hypoallergenic infant
formulas](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920165) (2000).

> Mothers should eliminate peanuts and tree-nuts (e.g. almonds, walnuts) and
consider eliminating eggs, cows-milk, fish and perhaps other foods from their
diets when nursing.

Side-note â€” it's very difficult to access the advice paper above.

A 2015 [Randomized Trial of Peanut Consumption in Infants at Risk for Peanut
Allergy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850) notes that:

> The prevalence of peanut allergy among children in Western countries has
doubled in the past 10 years, and peanut allergy is becoming apparent in
Africa and Asia.

Design:

> We randomly assigned 640 infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both to
consume or avoid peanuts until 60 months of age.

Result:

> Among the 530 infants in the intention-to-treat population [...] the
prevalence of peanut allergy at 60 months of age was 13.7% in the avoidance
group and 1.9% in the consumption group (P<0.001).

This is the first synchronous session.

Some quick notes on:

* [Ode to code](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/code-basics/to_code.html)
* [Surviving the
  computer](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/surviving_computers.html)

Next we discuss the first preparation exercise - the [Gapminder certificate
test](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/c/sdg-world-un-goals/).  For each:

* What information were you using when you gave your answer?
* Why did you have the wrong information?  Or what information were you missing, and why?
* How could you have got the right information to answer the question?

We will start by discussing the first preparation exercise - the Gapminder
exercise on how to be wrong â€” see the content page for that exercise.

Then we will move on to some revision on Python, the Jupyter, Pandas, and
working with the cloud system we have set up for the School this year.

We will cover some of the material in these textbook pages:

* [Using Jupyter Notebooks](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/using_jupyter.html)
* [More on Jupyter Notebooks](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/more_on_jupyter.html)
